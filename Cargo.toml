[dependencies]
# SemVer rules: Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.
# WARNING: Although dependencies in Cargo.toml look like a specific version of the crate, they are just like a caret version (^x.y.z) and actually specify 
# the minimum version and allow automatic SemVer compatible updates up to a MAJOR increment! Always check the true version with `cargo tree`!
